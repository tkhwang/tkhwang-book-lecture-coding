We can’t avoid every impact of climate \\nchange, but our infrastructure, public services, and residents are \\nprotected from the ravages of extreme weather. Every New Yorker \\nbenefits from these changes, which were undertaken in a fair way, \\nand our adapted city is a model for the world to follow. \\nIN 2050, NEW YORKERS NO LONGER RELY  \\nON CARS.\\nOur streets are safe and easy to navigate, reclaimed for people. \\nSubways and buses are fast and reliable, taking people where they \\nneed to go and connecting our city to the wider metropolitan \\nregion. Bicycle lanes abound and walking is a favorite way of \\ngetting around town. For many New Yorkers, the daily commute \\nto work is a scenic ferry ride. New modes of transportation, \\nenabled by technology and responsibly deployed, add to the \\nmobility options throughout the five boroughs.\\nIN 2050, NEW YORKERS ARE SECURE IN THEIR \\nHOMES AND NEIGHBORHOODS.\\nSafe, affordable housing is available in all five boroughs, and \\nour neighborhoods are more diverse and dynamic than ever. \\nCommunities are safe, the air and water are clean, and there are \\nabundant open spaces for all to enjoy. In every neighborhood, there \\nare cultural centers and libraries, small businesses and corner \\ngroceries open for late night shopping.

We \\nhave extreme wealth alongside dire poverty and \\nhomelessness. There is unmatched cultural and \\npopulation diversity amid some of the most racial-\\nly segregated urban neighborhoods in the United \\nStates. Our landmark skyscrapers are recognizable \\nworldwide, and towering high-rises are reshap-\\ning our skyline. Yet in many neighborhoods most \\nbuildings are just a few stories tall. \\nOur city gave rise to social justice movements and \\ninfluential figures fighting for equality, and our \\nstreets are hotbeds of public activism. But we are \\nstill confronting injustice and social and economic \\ninequities and a lack of faith in civic institutions. \\nNew York City’s subway system is one of the largest \\nin the world, but it is decaying due to neglect and \\ndisinvestment. We have hundreds of miles of ma-\\njestic waterfront, and a natural harbor, both built \\nfor commerce, but which now, in an era of climate \\nchange, are exposed and endangered.\\nTHESE CONTRADICTIONS EXIST AGAINST THE \\nBACKDROP OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATION-\\nAL POLITICAL TRENDS THAT HAVE LED TO \\nBROAD DISTRUST IN GOVERNMENT.

Across the globe, \\ngovernments are failing to take necessary actions \\nto protect the climate, address economic inequi-\\nty, and secure basic human rights, requiring that \\nglobal cities such as New York take the lead and \\nform partnerships to address these issues. \\nAs we look to 2050, the challenges facing New \\nYork City are significant, but we have faced chal-\\nlenges of equal measure before and prevailed. \\nToday, we are stronger than at any time in our \\nhistory.

Yet \\nwe also know there is much to be done to address critical \\nchallenges such as climate change, increasing unaffordabil-\\nity, and failing infrastructure that have been decades, if not \\ngenerations, in the making. Now we must go further. \\nThe following pages outline 30 strategic initiatives New \\nYork City will undertake to achieve this vision for 2050. \\nHIGHLIGHTS OF THE STRATEGY, WHICH LAY THE FOUN-\\nDATION FOR TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE, INCLUDE:\\n1. COMMITTING TO CARBON NEUTRALITY BY 2050,  \\nand a just transition that benefits all New Yorkers. We \\nwill be a leader among global cities by pursuing steep \\ncuts in greenhouse gas emissions from buildings and \\nsourcing 100 percent clean electricity, while creating \\ngreen jobs and holding polluters responsible for cli-\\nmate-related costs.\\n2. LEADING BY EXAMPLE ON CLIMATE CHANGE  by \\nending City purchases of unnecessary single-use plastic \\nfoodware and phasing out the purchase of processed \\nmeat, cutting beef purchasing in half, committing to a \\ncarbon neutral City fleet by 2040, pursuing expanding \\nmandatory organics collection citywide, and undertak-\\ning comprehensive projects to mitigate climate risk, \\nincluding Lower Manhattan Coastal Resiliency.\\n3. INTRODUCING CONGESTION PRICING, to reduce \\ntraffic in Manhattan and generate funds for essential \\nsubway repairs and enhancements, while dramati -\\ncally improving bus service through expanded and \\nimproved bus lanes, stronger bus lane enforcement, \\nand signal improvements that prioritize buses as they \\ntravel through city streets.\\n4. RECLAIMING STREETS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE \\nPUBLIC by creating People Priority Zones that restrict \\nvehicular access, create public spaces, improve safety, \\nreduce congestion, and improve air quality. We will \\nstart with a zone in Lower Manhattan to test a potential \\nexpansion citywide. \\n5. GUARANTEEING HEALTH CARE for every New Yorker, \\nto create the most comprehensive, universal coverage \\nin the nation for uninsured New Yorkers, regardless of \\nability to pay or immigration status.\\n6. ENDING THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC by treating substance \\nmisuse as the public health emergency it is, investing \\n$60 million to distribute naloxone kits and provide \\ntraining, expanding peer counseling at hospitals, and \\ndeploying engagement teams alongside first responders \\nto support people with mental health and substance \\nmisuse needs.\\n7. EXPANDING THE IDNYC municipal ID card to enable \\nbanking access for more than 1 million underbanked \\nNew Yorkers, saving low-income households as much as \\n10 percent of their paychecks from avoided fees. \\n8.

At the same time, we are naturally growing, \\nas more New Yorkers are born every year than die. While this \\ngrowth reinforces our diversity and fuels the economy, it also \\ncreates greater competition for the city’s spaces and services, \\ndrives a need for more housing, and transforms neighborhoods. \\nTo ensure New York City remains a safe, welcoming, and  \\nexciting place that attracts a broad mix of people, we must  \\nmake investments to proactively accommodate this growth. \\nOtherwise the competition will only intensify, and the city \\nwill become increasingly unaffordable, particularly for our \\nmost vulnerable residents, including the elderly, low-income \\nhouseholds, and immigrants.\\nSupplying more housing is key to affordability. Despite record \\nconstruction of affordable housing since 2014, we face an acute \\nhousing shortage and rising rents in many neighborhoods. Overall \\nhousing development has not kept pace with the rising population \\nand the number of people in need. Today, more than half of New \\nYorkers are rent burdened, spending more than 30 percent of \\ntheir income on housing; more than a quarter are severely rent \\nburdened, spending more than half their income on housing.  \\nThe number of rent-burdened New Yorkers continues to grow. \\nThe impacts of the housing crisis are severe. Rent-burdened, low-\\nincome residents are forced to compromise on housing quality or \\noverextend themselves to make ends meet. Some residents have been \\nforced to leave New York, and many others who might otherwise \\nconsider moving here stay away. Businesses may struggle to attract \\npotential employees, who have difficulty finding suitable housing \\nthey can afford. Rising rents also push out small businesses, many \\nof which are family owned, as well as community organizations that \\ncan no longer find space. In an increasingly dynamic and rapidly \\nchanging environment, people and businesses often struggle to \\nmaintain their place.\\nTo meet the demands of a growing population and economy, more \\nhousing units and commercial spaces are needed to ease pressure \\non the existing housing stock and stabilize and reduce rents over \\ntime. While it may appear as though New York is constantly \\nbuilding, housing construction over the last decade is lower than \\nduring past growth spurts, and is still making up ground from \\nprevious dips. In addition, while significant development has been \\nconcentrated in Manhattan and in the western portions of Brooklyn \\nand Queens, more housing is needed in neighborhoods across the \\ncity, particularly in transit-rich neighborhoods that can support a \\nlarger population and more mixed-income rental housing, but where \\ncurrent land use rules restrict new construction, contributing to the \\nrise in rents. \\nWith a connected housing market, New York City cannot address \\nunaffordability entirely on its own. Regional forecasts suggest that, \\ncollectively, our region might grow by more than 2 million people \\nby 2040, which translates into about 40,000 new households a \\nyear. As the region’s largest city, we must find ways to support our \\nregional neighbors also working to address housing demand and \\naccommodate the region’s growth equitably.\\nA growing population and economy are critical to addressing \\naffordability, so we must leverage our strengths to close the \\naffordability gap. If New York City becomes too expensive and out \\nof reach for many residents, the benefits of living here will belong \\nto only a small segment of the population. We would become a \\ncity that is less welcoming and less fair.\\n50,000\\n100,000\\n150,000\\n200,000\\n250,000\\nNUMBER OF RENTER-OCCUPIED \\nHOUSEHOLDS\\n% OF HUD INCOME LIMIT (FISCAL YEAR 2017)\\n0-10\\n100-11030-40 130-14070-80 160-17010-20 110-12040-50 140-15080-90 170-180 190-20020-30 120-13060-70 150-16090-100 180-19050-60\\nSEVERELY RENT BURDENED\\nMODERATELY RENT BURDENED\\nPUBLIC HOUSING/RENTAL ASSISTANCE\\nNOT BURDENED, NO RENTAL ASSISTANCE'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T10:57:03-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T16:36:59-05:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/OneNYC-2050-Summary.pdf', 'total_pages': 60, 'page': 25, 'page_label': '26'}, page_content='26   |   O neNYC 2050 \\nNYC.GOV/O neNYC\\nNearly two-thirds of the land \\nused for housing in New \\nYork City is for one- and two-\\nfamily homes.

The city’s density is \\nkey to this, and to our city’s identity.\\nNew York City has the highest population density of any major city \\nin the United States, with more than 27,000 people per square mile. \\nDensity comes in many shapes and sizes, and creates thriving, \\nmixed-use neighborhoods, where New Yorkers from different \\nbackgrounds live together and streets are filled with retail and \\ncommunity uses. It enables one of the largest transit systems in the \\nworld, which helps New Yorkers maintain the lowest per-person \\ncarbon footprint of any big city in the country. Density supports \\nunparalleled cultural offerings, renowned schools and universities, \\nand leading health care institutions. The city we enjoy exists \\nbecause density contributes to a vibrant economy, a walkable city, \\nand world-famous nightlife less dense cities simply cannot sustain.\\nNew York City is also unique because it is the only large, old U.S. \\ncity that has grown far beyond its historical peak population – \\nsince 1970, we have added more than half a million new residents. \\nThis growth has been possible because of the strong infrastructure \\nwe inherited, and our ability to use it more efficiently and extend \\nits capacity. Our capacity to grow is not infinite – we expect \\ngrowth to slow as we approach and exceed a population of 9 \\nmillion by 2050 – but as long as the city’s economy and quality of \\nlife are strong, we can expect existing residents seeking to stay, and \\nnew immigrants wishing to move here.\\nAs more people call New York City home, we will still have only \\n300 square miles of land. To accommodate our children and the \\nnext generation of newcomers, the City must find ways to use land \\nmore efficiently, and to make the key investments we need to grow \\nboth sustainably and equitably. Without finding places to locate more \\nhousing, we would be unable to provide options for all the people \\nsearching for a place to live every year, forcing increasing competition \\nfor existing housing and leading to rent hikes. Many New Yorkers \\nunable to afford these increased housing costs would be displaced and \\nthe city will become more unwelcoming and less fair.\\nMaking room for additional residents can occur in many ways, \\nsuited to the needs of different neighborhoods and the capacity of \\nour transportation and other infrastructure. Today it consists of \\nduplexes in Elmhurst, mid-rises in Bedford-Stuyvesant, and towers \\nin Murray Hill. Looking ahead to future growth, high-density, \\ntransit-rich neighborhoods can add more residents through \\ninnovative building practices such as micro-units. Lower-density \\nneighborhoods can support growth through incremental additions \\nto the housing supply, such as East New York’s pilot basement \\napartment program, or through zoning changes to allow for \\nmultifamily housing near transit. As we plan for more mixed-use \\nprojects in the boroughs, we will bring not only new housing but \\nalso jobs and services closer to new population centers.\\nAs we strive to become a strong and fair city, we must continue to \\nfind ways to accommodate this growing family and leverage the \\nbenefits of our density and dynamism to protect our city’s legacy. \\nMIXED-USE COMMERCIAL  \\n& RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS\\nMULTI-FAMILY ELEVATOR HOUSING\\nMULTI-FAMILY WALK-UP HOUSING\\n1-2 FAMILY HOUSING\\n= 100 ACRES\\nMAKING ROOM FOR MORE NEW YORKERS'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T10:57:03-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T16:36:59-05:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/OneNYC-2050-Summary.pdf', 'total_pages': 60, 'page': 26, 'page_label': '27'}, page_content='27   |   O neNYC 2050\\nNYC.GOV/O neNYC'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T10:57:03-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T16:36:59-05:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/OneNYC-2050-Summary.pdf', 'total_pages': 60, 'page': 27, 'page_label': '28'}, page_content='28   |   O neNYC 2050\\nNYC.GOV/O neNYC\\nChallenge #2\\nECONOMIC INSECURITY\\nThe city’s economy is evolving in parallel with global trends, \\ncreating unrivalled opportunities for new businesses and jobs.

Persistent inequalities in wealth and \\nincome, as well as health and education, are inextricably linked \\nand underscore the reality that New Yorkers have not benefited \\nequally from the city’s prosperity, both in the past and today, \\nrequiring even stronger action by the City to promote equity.\\nThe gaps are starkest when viewed through the lens of race \\nand gender. In fact, while the gender pay gap in New York is \\ncomparatively lower than nationally, women — and women of \\ncolor in particular — continue to face significant inequity. In \\n2016, black women working full-time in New York City made 57 \\ncents for every dollar paid to white men; over a 40-year career, \\nthe median full-time working Hispanic woman in New York \\nCity loses $1.5 million in earnings due to the gender wage gap. \\nWhile unemployment has fallen dramatically for all groups \\nsince the last recession, it remains significantly higher for black \\nand Hispanic workers; as of 2017, the average black worker in \\nNew York City was twice as likely to be without work than a \\ncomparably educated white New Yorker.\\nThe disparities in wealth between white and nonwhite \\nhouseholds are even greater. Nationally, the median wealth \\nof white families is more than $100,000, while black median \\nwealth hovers around $10,000. This divide has deep, long-term \\nimplications. When black children become adults, they are far \\nless likely than their white counterparts to get financial help from \\ntheir parents for higher education — a disparity that has financial \\nconsequences over the course of the adult child’s life, reinforcing \\ninequities across generations.\\nInequities in New York City are reinforced by segregated neigh -\\nborhoods. Only one in four New Yorkers lives in a racially \\nintegrated neighborhood, and segregation, inequities in neigh -\\nborhood conditions, environmental injustice, and economic \\ndisparities all contribute to unequal health outcomes. Rates \\nof premature mortality and infant mortality are twice as high \\namong black New Yorkers than the citywide average. Life expec -\\ntancy in East Harlem, where residents are predominantly black \\nand Hispanic and poverty is more prevalent, is 8.6 years shorter \\nthan on the Upper East Side just a few blocks south, a predomi -\\nnantly white community with lower poverty. New York City has \\nthe highest disparity in exposure to air pollution between people \\nof color and white people, a contributing factor to heart and \\nrespiratory disease.\\nNew York City’s schools also grapple with the legacy of \\nsegregation and unequal policies. Though black and Hispanic \\nstudents make up nearly 70 percent of New York City’s public \\nschool system, in 2019, just over 10 percent of students admitted \\ninto the city’s eight specialized high schools were black or \\nHispanic. Moreover, the quality of education varies widely across \\nthe city, with students in economically disadvantaged households \\nperforming worse than their peers. Nearly three-quarters of all \\nNew York City public school students live in poverty. \\nAddressing persistent inequities in income, wealth, education, \\nand health is necessary in order to bring living standards across \\nthe city in alignment and provide equal opportunity to all \\nNew Yorkers. Without both an economic system that promotes \\nequitable growth and a concerted effort to improve services and \\naccess to care in historically neglected communities, New York \\nCity will fail to overcome the “tale of two cities” narrative that \\nhas plagued us for decades.\\nWealth and health inequities contribute to higher rates of \\npremature mortality among black New Yorkers.\\nSource: DOHMH\\n100\\n150\\n200\\n300\\n350\\n250\\n50 ASIAN\\nHISPANIC\\nBLACK\\nWHITE\\n2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T10:57:03-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T16:36:59-05:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/OneNYC-2050-Summary.pdf', 'total_pages': 60, 'page': 30, 'page_label': '31'}, page_content='31   |   O neNYC 2050\\nNYC.GOV/O neNYC\\nWE ARE A DIVERSE  \\nYET SEGREGATED CITY.  \\nDespite New York City’s plurality, the city remains \\ndivided.

Extreme heat is now the \\nnumber one cause of mortality from weather conditions, and \\nextreme storms can be ruinous. When Hurricane Sandy landed in \\n2012, it killed 44 people and caused $19 billion in damage in New \\nYork City alone. If we don’t act now, we will see major disruptions \\nto the global food supply, mass migrations as regions become \\nuninhabitable, declining biodiversity, and unpredictable impacts on \\nour economy and way of life. \\nThe cause is clear: Burning fossil fuels is the largest contributor \\nto human-caused climate change. Unfortunately, climate change \\nis a national emergency without a national policy, and efforts to \\ncurb fossil fuels and GHG emissions have been stymied by federal \\nactions as well as federal inaction. Equally troubling, a decades-long \\ncampaign of deception and denial by fossil fuel companies has tried \\nto mislead policymakers and the public, delaying the transition \\naway from fossil fuels. Climate change is an emergency, and we \\nmust mobilize now if we hope to avoid catastrophic impacts.\\n \\nLet’s look at the science: On our current trajectory, global \\ntemperature increases of 4.7 to 8.6 degrees Fahrenheit are \\nanticipated by 2100. This will directly impact all New Yorkers. \\nBy 2050, without adaptation, more New Yorkers will die each \\nsummer from intense heat. At the same time, greater dependence \\non air conditioning will place heightened demand on the city’s \\nelectrical grid, increasing the chances of larger and longer \\nblackouts in summer months and leading to infrastructure \\noutages and spoiled food and medicine stocks. It will also impact \\nour ability to meet renewable energy targets, and heighten risk \\nfor the elderly and other populations especially vulnerable to \\nheat-related illnesses.\\nHigh tides will cause flooding twice a day in some coastal \\ncommunities, and permanent inundation in others. Without \\nadded protections, severe storms could put most of Coney \\nIsland, the Rockaway peninsula, Hunts Point, Throggs Neck, \\nEast Harlem, and the East Shore of Staten Island under water. \\nIn New York City, climate change will have increasingly severe \\nconsequences for our health, our economy, and our quality of \\nlife, with a disproportionate burden falling on the city’s most \\nvulnerable populations and communities.\\n \\nNew York City, because of its density and public transportation \\nsystem, has long had a smaller per capita carbon footprint than \\nany other big city in the United States — and we have made \\nsignificant progress reducing GHG emissions over the last decade, \\nusing new technologies and innovations to get us there.

Without \\nnew funding and upgrades, the essential systems that connect New \\nYorkers to their communities, jobs, local businesses, and schools \\n— and that are essential to meeting our climate impact goals — \\nwill continue to deteriorate. And as we look to the changing needs \\nof the 21st century, we must also address the need for new digital \\ninfrastructure, public health resources to fight infectious disease \\nthreats, and resiliency to cyber-attacks and other threats.\\nGetting around New York City is increasingly frustrating. Subways \\nare chronically underfunded, leading to declining reliability and \\nfrequent disruptions. Buses are often stuck on traffic-clogged \\nstreets. This forces New Yorkers to find alternative and often costlier \\ntransportation, such as for-hire vehicles that — together with the \\nproliferation of vehicles making online retail deliveries — worsen \\ncongestion, reduce the efficiency of above-ground transit, such as \\nbuses, and contribute to air pollution and the city’s carbon footprint.\\nMajor repair and expansion projects remain underfunded due \\nto a lack of federal support. This includes Gateway, a critical \\nreplacement rail-tunnel system connecting Manhattan with New \\nJersey that is one of the most important infrastructure projects \\nin the country. The regional economy would grind to a halt in \\nthe event of a tunnel shutdown, causing $16 billion in economic \\ndamage over an estimated four-year repair cycle and impacting \\nmillions of lives, according to the Regional Plan Association.\\nNew York City’s sewer mains are on average 85 years old, water \\nmains are 70 years old, and our electric grid dates back to the \\n1920s. One out of every 10 bridges and tunnels is structurally \\ndeficient. These deteriorating systems cause costly and dangerous \\nleaks and outages that impact residents and businesses. To restore \\npublic housing, the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) \\nestimates total capital needs of $32 billion, following decades of \\nfederal spending cuts. This disinvestment has severely hurt public \\nhousing residents, who face unreliable heat in winter as well as \\nlong wait times for repairs.\\n \\nOur modern infrastructure is not much better: Nearly one-third \\nof all New Yorkers do not have access to high-speed broadband \\ninternet at home, creating a digital divide that impacts economic \\nopportunity and quality of life. To be competitive in the 21st \\ncentury requires a population that is digitally literate and \\nprepared for jobs in the burgeoning tech sector. At the same time, \\ncyber-attacks pose an increasing risk. In 2016, hackers targeted \\ncompanies in the financial services sector more than any other. As \\nhackers become more sophisticated, and the city’s digital footprint \\nincreases with ever-more data, platforms, and systems, New York \\nCity — and our position as a global economic center — requires \\nforward-thinking investment to leverage the power of technology \\nto keep New Yorkers and our economy safe.\\nWe also face strains on our public health infrastructure. New York \\nCity is uniquely at risk of an infectious disease emergency, given \\nthe city’s density, crowded mass transit systems, and role as an \\ninternational travel hub.\\nNew York City can no longer put off massive investments to \\nmodernize our critical physical systems, leverage smart city tools, \\nmeet the evolving needs of digital connectivity, and protect the city \\nagainst disease and cyber-attacks. If we don’t identify ways to invest \\nin 21st century infrastructure sustainably, we risk ceding our global \\ncompetitiveness and worsening quality of life and inequity.\\nSince 2012, on-time performance for MTA subways has \\ndecreased by 25% and ridership has dropped off.\\nSource: MTA\\n100%1.80B\\n90%1.75B\\n80%1.70B\\n70%1.65B\\n2012\\nSUBWAY RIDERSHIP (BILLIONS)\\nANNUAL RIDERS\\nON-TIME PERFORMANCE\\nON-TIME PERFORMANCE\\n2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T10:57:03-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T16:36:59-05:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/OneNYC-2050-Summary.pdf', 'total_pages': 60, 'page': 34, 'page_label': '35'}, page_content='35   |   O neNYC 2050\\nNYC.GOV/O neNYC\\nResidents report a widespread feeling that the government is not \\nlistening to their voice, or their needs, especially in communities \\nhistorically left out of City decision-making.\\nRecent federal actions have also undermined global diplomacy, \\nwhich is critical to creating more democratic societies around the \\nworld.

While not unique to New York City, they left \\na deep legacy of inequity. Redlining deprived communities of \\ncolor access to federally backed home loans, creating segregated \\nneighborhoods upheld by public policy. Urban renewal projects \\ndisplaced thousands of people, mostly communities of color, \\nto make way for highways, housing projects, and civic centers, \\nwhile unequal siting decisions subjected poor communities to \\nincreased pollution.

Economic security and dignity are essential to \\novercoming long-standing inequities and creating a \\ncity where who you are doesn’t determine your success. \\nTherefore, we must build AN INCLUSIVE ECONOMY  \\nthat attracts and grows good-paying jobs and \\nguarantees fair wages and dignified work conditions. \\n3. Our lives are better and our social ties are \\nstronger when New Yorkers feel secure in their \\ncommunities. Therefore, we must support THRIVING \\nNEIGHBORHOODS  with safe, affordable housing and \\nample community resources. \\n4. Health care is a human right. Therefore, we must \\npromote HEALTHY LIVES  by guaranteeing access to \\nquality health care and a healthy environment for all, \\nregardless of neighborhood, income, race or ethnicity, \\nor gender.\\n5. A quality education is an essential step to building a \\nfulfilling life. Therefore, we must provide EQUITY AND \\nEXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION  with a focus on creating \\nstrong schools that reflect the diversity of thought, \\nbackgrounds, and experiences of the communities they serve.\\n6. Inaction on climate change will impact every corner of the \\ncity, with disproportionate harm to our most vulnerable \\nresidents. Therefore, we must secure A LIVABLE CLIMATE  \\nfor the next generation with a just transition that ends our \\nreliance on fossil fuels, fully prepares for the impacts of \\nclimate change, and achieves climate justice.\\n7. Access to affordable, reliable, safe, and sustainable \\ntransportation is central to New York’s competitiveness \\nand livability. Therefore, we must ensure EFFICIENT \\nMOBILITY  for all by restoring our subways and buses to \\nworld-class status so no New Yorker needs to rely on a car.\\n8. Resilient infrastructure is the foundation on which we \\nbuild a strong and fair city. Therefore, we will invest in \\nMODERN INFRASTRUCTURE  that serves the needs of \\nNew Yorkers and creates the systems to better deliver that \\ninfrastructure.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T10:57:03-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T16:36:59-05:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/OneNYC-2050-Summary.pdf', 'total_pages': 60, 'page': 43, 'page_label': '44'}, page_content='44   |   O neNYC 2050\\nNYC.GOV/O neNYC\\nA VIBRANT DEMOCRACY\\nWHERE EVERY NEW YORKER IS WELCOMED INTO \\nTHE CIVIC AND DEMOCRATIC LIFE OF THE CITY\\nNationally and globally, renewed forces of exclusion — \\nnationalism, anti-immigrant sentiment, and hate crimes — \\nthreaten the values and communities that make New York City \\na model of inclusion around the world, while declining trust \\nin government and civic institutions weakens our cohesion as \\na city.

A growing population \\nsupports diversity and injects new energy \\ninto our neighborhoods. A growing \\neconomy supports new jobs and provides \\ntax revenue to fund schools, transit, and \\nother public services. Growth keeps New \\nYork City competitive with peer cities \\naround the world. But at a time of rising \\nhousing costs and economic uncertainty, \\ngrowth alone is not enough. As we grow, \\nwe must ensure our neighborhoods \\nremain livable and affordable, and that all \\nNew Yorkers benefit — not just the few.\\n \\nTHE VALUES OF  \\nOneNYC 2050\\n \\nRESILIENCY\\nResiliency is both a defining feature \\nof New Yorkers and a necessity as we \\nface an increasingly uncertain future. \\nNew York City has faced and overcome \\ncatastrophic disasters, from 9/11 to \\nHurricane Sandy, and emerged stronger \\nthrough the strength and resolve of our \\npeople. Now more than ever we need to \\nready our neighborhoods, economy, and \\npublic services to withstand the impacts \\nof climate change and other 21 st century \\nthreats — from cyber threats to public \\nhealth epidemics — and emerge stronger.\\nEQUITY \\nEquity is the bedrock of our future vision \\nfor New York City. New Yorkers deserve \\nfair pay and benefits, opportunities \\nfor economic advancement, and a \\nsecure retirement. Children from all \\nneighborhoods are entitled to a quality \\neducation and a chance to pursue \\ntheir dreams. No New Yorker should \\nface higher health risks or lower life \\nexpectancy because of where they live. \\nAll communities should be safe, and all \\nresidents treated with dignity and respect \\nno matter their gender or race. And all \\nNew Yorkers should have a voice in our \\ncity’s future.\\n \\nSUSTAINABILITY\\nSustainability is how New York City \\nsecures our future. With the world’s \\nlargest subway, and dense, walkable \\nneighborhoods, New Yorkers have long \\nleft a lighter environmental footprint \\nthan other Americans — but we need \\nto go much further to preserve our \\nway of life. We need to eliminate our \\ncontributions to climate-change-causing \\nGHG emissions, and build neighborhoods \\nand infrastructure that support \\nsustainable lifestyles and consumption, \\nwhile creating economic opportunity for \\nall.\\nDIVERSITY & \\nINCLUSION\\nDiversity & Inclusion defines who we are \\nas a city. For centuries, New York City \\nhas welcomed people from all cultures, \\nreligions, and identities. New Yorkers \\ntake pride in the incredibly diverse mix of \\npeople we encounter every day. Our city is \\nstrongest when we celebrate our diversity \\nand aim to create a city where people from \\nall backgrounds can find their way and \\ncontribute to their communities and city.\\n \\nWe will build \\na strong and \\nfair city. \\nWe will be \\nOneNYC. \\nJoin us.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T10:57:03-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T16:36:59-05:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/OneNYC-2050-Summary.pdf', 'total_pages': 60, 'page': 48, 'page_label': '49'}, page_content='MAYOR DE BLASIO CELEBRATES THE RELEASE OF  ONENYC IN 2015.\\nAP/Seth Wenig\\nSTRATEGIC PLANNING  \\nIN NEW YORK CITY\\nIn 2007, New York City released PlaNYC 2030, a successful effort \\nto bring sustainability planning to New York City and confront \\nthe challenges of the time: namely economic and population\\ngrowth and their impacts on infrastructure.

But we cannot afford federal failure if we are to fully meet \\nthe challenges facing our City. A robust federal response to the challenges of our day is not \\njust important, it is essential. Historically, while Members of Congress representing New York \\nCity have led the fight to improve this situation, others in Washington refuse to deal with the \\nproblems facing our city and country, leaving us where we are today. \\nNEW YORK CITY CAN’T DO THIS ALONE\\nTHE INVESTMENTS IN FIGHTING CLIMATE \\nCHANGE THAT THE GREEN NEW DEAL \\nDEMANDS: The world faces an existential threat from climate \\nchange. Every time those in Washington who understand this \\nreality make a step forward, others find a way to force us back. \\nAs Washington pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement, New \\nYork City served as a model for cities to keep the commitment. \\nWe need a national commitment out of Washington, like the \\nGreen New Deal demands, to invest in combating climate \\nchange, build a carbon-free electricity grid powered fully by \\nclean energy, retrofit our buildings to make them more energy \\nefficient, and transition away from reliance on fossil fuels for our \\ntransportation needs. These actions are essential to averting the \\nworst threats of climate change for New Yorkers.\\n \\nINVEST IN NEW YORK CITY’S \\nINFRASTRUCTURE: The American Society of Civil \\nEngineers gives U.S. infrastructure a D+ grade. This problem \\ndid not develop overnight, it’s due to decades of federal \\nunderinvestment in infrastructure. We need a national \\ninfrastructure strategy to become a stronger, safer, more \\naccessible City, with investments in mass transit, freight, high-\\nspeed rail, bridges, tunnels, highways, broadband and housing. \\nWe need renewed investment in water and power infrastructure \\nto secure a 100 percent renewable energy future and a just \\ntransition for communities disproportionately impacted by \\nclimate change. We need the federal government to keep its \\ncommitment to build the Gateway tunnels — helping to create \\njobs and improve New York City’s economy.\\n \\nCREATING A FAIRER SOCIETY: The economy is \\nchanging and working class people are being left behind. New \\nYorkers are working longer hours than ever but don’t see the \\nwealth that they help create. We need change in order to avert \\nthe concentration of wealth in the 1 percent, and the first step \\nis repealing the portion of the 2017 tax cuts that benefited big \\ncorporations and the rich. We can put these funds to better \\nuse – investing in infrastructure, education, and services to help \\nthose most in need. Then we need a national recommitment \\nto supporting and protecting workers, with a higher minimum \\nwage, paid sick leave, paid family leave, and other protections for \\nworkers. We must strengthen the right of all workers to organize \\nand collectively bargain, and we must create real economic \\nopportunity through support for college, job training, and access \\nto capital for starting businesses. If the federal government won’t \\nstep up then New York City will have to step in. Because we can’t \\ndo it with one hand tied behind our back, the cap on the State \\nand local tax deduction must be eliminated. \\nA COMPREHENSIVE RESILIENCY AGENDA: \\nWashington’s approach to resiliency is completely backwards, \\nonly providing resources after devastating events like Hurricane \\nSandy, instead of protecting communities from increasingly \\ndangerous natural disasters before they strike. We need a change \\n– a national commitment to resiliency and disaster preparation, \\nwith proactive infrastructure investment for coastal protections, \\nincreased funding for disaster relief, catastrophe insurance, and \\nfunds for states and localities to prepare, respond, repair, and \\nrebuild.\\n \\nCOMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM: Less \\nthan a decade ago, comprehensive immigration reform seemed \\nwithin reach, but a few in Washington have repeatedly blocked \\naction, leaving us with a system that is now being exploited \\nto spread fear and chaos in our cities. These cruel and unjust \\npolicies do not reflect New York City’s values. Immigrants also \\ncontribute to our economic success, including providing over \\n$2 billion to the GDP in our city, and we must find a way to \\nlegally grow, not halt, this impact. We need a change – real and \\ncomprehensive immigration reform. Let’s start by passing H.R. \\n6 - The American Dream and Promise Act.\\n \\nNYC.GOV/O neNYC52   |   O neNYC 2050\\nFiscal support from the \\nfederal government has \\ndeclined significantly \\nsince the 1980s.\\nREAD MORE ON PAGE 21.'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T10:57:03-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T16:36:59-05:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/OneNYC-2050-Summary.pdf', 'total_pages': 60, 'page': 52, 'page_label': '53'}, page_content='NATIONAL INVESTMENT IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING: \\nThanks to years of neglect from Washington we face an affordability \\ncrisis in New York City. Instead of proposing new rules that make it \\nharder on the poorest New Yorkers, Washington should be investing in \\ncreating new affordable housing and expanding the Section 8 program. \\nInstead of the decades of disinvestment in public housing, the federal \\ngovernment should provide the resources to preserve these vital public \\nassets, and help fund capital needs at NYCHA, including the gap \\nin its physical needs assessment. Instead of ignoring protections to \\nensure fair housing, Washington should work night and day to prevent \\ndiscrimination in housing policy.\\n \\nA COMMITMENT TO EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION: \\nNew York City is leading the country on early childhood education, \\ndemonstrating that Pre-K and 3-K are vital to ensuring that all \\nchildren have the strong educational foundation they need to succeed. \\nStudies have found that students who attend two years of preschool \\nare better prepared for kindergarten and perform significantly higher \\non academic and social outcome measures compared to children \\nwho attend only one year. We cannot reach the full potential without \\nsupport from the federal government. We need a federal government \\nthat believes in the importance of investing in the next generation \\nof New Yorkers and recognizes that a strong public education is \\na cornerstone of our democracy. We need to increase Head Start \\nfunding, and we need federal resources to continue to support Pre-K \\nfor All and to expand 3K for All across the city.\\nFIXING OUR BROKEN DEMOCRACY: New York City has \\nrecently made great strides on campaign finance reform, helping \\nto restore faith in our democratic processes. But Washington must \\nreform campaign finance laws at a national level and begin the \\nprocess to reverse the Citizens United decision and eliminate the \\nElectoral College. We must make it easier to vote, so that no one is \\ndenied their right to participate because of long lines or language \\nbarriers. Washington must fully fund the 2020 Census and remove \\nthe citizenship question so that we can ensure an accurate, fair and \\norderly count and make sure New York City gets its fair share of \\nfederal resources and representation.\\nGUARANTEED HEALTH CARE AND MENTAL HEALTH \\nCARE FOR ALL: Washington made great progress in improving \\nthe lives of millions of Americans when it passed the Affordable Care \\nAct. Yet almost immediately opponents went to work trying to delay, \\nrepeal and sabotage the bill. Washington needs to strengthen, not \\nundermine, the ACA, and then must work to quickly establish a truly \\nuniversal healthcare system. In the absence of federal action, New York \\nCity is filling the gap with NYC Care, but Washington must be held \\naccountable for ensuring that all New Yorkers have access to quality \\nhealthcare. New York City has made huge progress in addressing the \\nmental health needs of New Yorkers through Thrive NYC, but we need \\nfederal support to fully confront the scourge and stigma of mental \\nhealth concerns that affect 20 percent of our population. Passing the \\nExcellence in Mental Health and Addiction Treatment Expansion Act \\nand the Comprehensive Addiction Resources Emergency Act would \\nhelp set us on the right path.\\nNYC.GOV/O neNYC53   |   O neNYC 2050'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T10:57:03-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T16:36:59-05:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/OneNYC-2050-Summary.pdf', 'total_pages': 60, 'page': 53, 'page_label': '54'}, page_content='APPENDIX\\n54   |   O neNYC 2050 \\nNYC.GOV/O neNYC'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'Adobe PDF Library 15.0', 'creator': 'Adobe InDesign 14.0 (Windows)', 'creationdate': '2019-04-30T10:57:03-04:00', 'moddate': '2020-01-03T16:36:59-05:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'data/OneNYC-2050-Summary.pdf', 'total_pages': 60, 'page': 54, 'page_label': '55'}, page_content='55   |   O neNYC 2050\\nNYC.GOV/O neNYC\\nBrookings Institution, New Evidence on School Choice and Racially \\nSegregated Schools (2017)\\nBureau of Labor Statistics\\nCenter for an Urban Future, State of Work Report (2018)\\nCitizens Budget Commission, Rent Burden Report (2018)\\nFederal Reserve, Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. \\nHouseholds (2017)\\nFurman Center, Changing Racial and Ethnic Makeup of New York \\nCity Neighborhoods (2011)\\nIndependent Budget Office, New York City Fiscal History (2018)\\nIndependent Commission on New York City Criminal Justice and \\nIncarceration Reform, A More Just New York City (2017)\\nInternational Panel on Climate Change, Special Report on Global \\nWarming of 1.5°C (2018)\\nKlinenberg, Eric.
