# OpenAI Configuration (required for image generation)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Optional: Imgflip credentials for advanced meme template features
# IMGFLIP_USERNAME=your_imgflip_username
# IMGFLIP_PASSWORD=your_imgflip_password

# Note: Some features work without API keys:
# - Frustration extraction (uses OpenAI but can be mocked)
# - Meme template search (Imgflip API works without auth for basic features)
# - Meme generation (Imgflip provides stable URLs without additional hosting)
#
# For the full experience, you'll need at least the OpenAI API key.
